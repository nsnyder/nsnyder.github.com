# Ideas

This seems to be a good spot to put some scratch work for ideas I've thought about,
or things that I want to think about.

## Inspiration

I thought it a good idea to take a look at some other personal sites around the web
and see what sorts of things I liked, and what sorts of things I didn't. This
is a collection of some of my observations.
