# Ideas

This seems to be a good spot to put some scratch work for ideas I've thought about,
or things that I want to think about.

## TODO

- Update bio to indicate that I'm a web developer. Work on verbiage and opening message.
- Setup Typescript
- Consider linking to blog?
- Watch [Debugging Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z61670MVQo)

## Inspiration

I thought it a good idea to take a look at some other personal sites around the web
and see what sorts of things I liked, and what sorts of things I didn't. This
is a collection of some of my observations.

I like everything about this site. It's sleek and simple, but with a clear personality.
But I'm linking this specific page, because I love what he's doing with columns.
I'll probably steal a snippet or two to use on my site.
