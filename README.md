[Nathan Snyder's website](www.snydern.com) is built using:
- Vue
- TailwindCSS

To make life easier in PHPStorm and other IntelliJ IDEs,
run:

```
mkdir .util
npx tailwind build src/styles/main.css -o .util/output.css
```

PHPStorm should pickup the file and autocomplete classes for you.
(Even if you're running an old version like me ðŸ˜…)
